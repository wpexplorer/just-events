== Description ==
The Just Events plugin registers a new event post type (just_event) to your WordPress site for easily adding events. The plugin provides the basic functionality to add events to your site for those looking for a very minimal solution without all the extra bloat of "traditional" event/calendar plugins. For this reason you won't find features like calendars, repeating events, tons of shortcodes, tickets, custom templates, etc.

This plugin works best with a "Full Site Editing" block theme so you can easily create your archives and single event templates using the included Event Date, Event Time, Event Status and Event Link blocks or with a compatible Classic WordPress theme such as our [Total WordPress theme](https://total.wpexplorer.com/).

== Features ==

* Event post type.
* Event fields for setting event details (all day, start date, end date, start time, end time and link).
* Works with Block and Classic themes.
* Uses theme templates and styles for a slim, fast and more compatible plugin.
* Four useful blocks: Event Date, Event Time, Event Link and Event Status.
* Two useful shortcodes: [just_events_event_date] and [just_events_event_time].
* Option to hide past events from event archives.
* Options to customize the event post type single and archive slugs.
* Options to set your default event date and time format.
* Options to modify the default formatted date and time separator.

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WordPress website admin panel
2. Select Plugins > Add New
3. Search for "Just Events"
4. Click Install
5. Activate the plugin
6. You will now see an "Events" tab in your WordPress admin for adding your events.
7. If using a Full Site Editing theme go to Appearance > Editor and create your single and archive templates (see FAQ).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the Just Events Plugin Free? =
Yes. The plugin is completely free of charge under the GPL license.

= Is there a premium version? =
No.

= Will the plugin work with my theme? =
Just Events should work with any theme, however, not all themes may have a system to easily display your events. The plugin works best with FSE (Full Site Editing) block themes or classic theme's that include built-in integration (ask the theme developer).

= How do I add events? =
After activating the plugin simply go to Events > Add New and you can start adding your events.

= Where can I view my events? =
By default your Event archives will exist at yoursite.com/events/ which will automatically display your events. You can modify the URL slug (events) via the settings panel at Events > Settings > Archive Slug.

If you wish to customize this page and you are using a full site editing block theme you can do so via Appearance > Editor. From here you can click the plus icon to "Add New Template" and click the "Archive: Event" option. If you are using a classic theme you will need to contact the theme developer and ask how to modify the layout as this will be dependent on the theme you are using.

= Why do my events look like blog posts? =
By default the event posts will take on the default post template layout of your theme. If you are using a full site editing block theme simply go to Appearance > Editor > Templates and click on the plus icon to "Add New Template" then select the "Single item: Event" option. Now you can create your custom event template and use the included Event Date, Event Time, Event Status and/or Event Link blocks to display your event data.

If you are using a classic WordPress theme you will need to contact the theme developer and ask how to modify the layout as this will be dependent on the theme you are using.
