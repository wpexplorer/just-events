== Description ==
The Just Events plugin adds a new event post type to your WordPress site for easily adding events. The plugin is intended to provide only the basic functionality to add event posts to your site for those looking for a very minimal solution without all the extra bloat of "traditional" event plugins. For this reason you won't find features like calendars, repeating events, tons of shortcodes, templates, patterns, etc.

This plugin will work best with a "full site editing" block theme or builder plugins (such as WPBakery or Elementor) so you can create your singular event templates and easily display your events on the site.

== Features ==

* Event post type.
* Event fields for setting event details (date, time, etc).
* Built-in integration for the Total theme (custom cards, dynamic templates).

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WordPress website admin panel
2. Select Plugins > Add New
3. Search for "Just Events"
4. Click Install
5. Activate the plugin
6. You will now see an "Events" tab in your WordPress admin for adding your events.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the Just Events Plugin Free? =
Yes. The plugin is completely free of charge and should work with any theme. However, not all themes may have a system to easily display your events.

= If there a premium version? =
No. We may consider creating addon plugins in the future but the base plugin will always be free.
